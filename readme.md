# Task
Data Science team is interested in predicting which users will sign up for a membership plan. A team member already structured a sample data set to explore this question for you. Data is provided with a name of ‘data.txt’. Unfortunately, most of data set labels were lost except for two columns. We know that the second to the last column is ‘Did a user signup?’ and the last column is ‘User_id’. 

1. Your task is to write code in python to answer below questions. 
Perform any data processing, necessary data analysis (a few bullet-points/plots should suffice). What’s the proportion of users signed up for a membership plan?

2. Build a predictive model whether users will sign up for a plan. What other models did you consider developing? Discuss pros and cons of your chosen model and other models, reasons of your chosen model and any concerns you have. How would you convince business that the model is valid?
